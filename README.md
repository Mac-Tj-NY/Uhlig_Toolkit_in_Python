A Simple Toolkit in Computational Analysis: Solving linear approximations of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models in Python

An abbreviated translation into Python of Harald Uhlig's solution method, as described in "A Tooklit for Analyzing Nonlinear Dynamic Stochastic Models Easily," Discussion Paper 101, Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, June 1995 and in his MATLAB code.
